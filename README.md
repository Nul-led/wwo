# Information
Repository dedicated to providing scripts and information on the game protocol of Werewolf Online.
While it is currently BIG work in progress, maybe you will find the wiki quite useful to understand the game's underlying mechanics.

### Disclaimer:
This repository and it's contents only exist for educational purposes. I am not interested in attacking any of Wolvevilles services and i advice YOU to never do that either.

Update 5th Dec 2021:
The repo is kinda out of date although some of the stuff still works, i would rather advice you to do your own research since i wont have time to update this for a while
